//    Create a Printer class that has a property for number of sheets of paper left.
//        Add a method to print that takes in a number of pages and number of copies.
//        The print method will only run if the printer has enough paper.
//        If it runs it will reduce the value of the paper left by number of copies * number of pages.
//        Add a toner volume property to the class.
//        Modify the printer so that it reduces the toner by 1 for each page printed.
